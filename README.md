## Photo Gear

This is a simple site to provide photographers a place to store all their gear, serial numbers, prices etc along with receipts and other documentation.

The aim is that it will provide a complete overview of the photographers gear.

It will allow the user to download the details along with the receipts files as an archive.

### Registration

The user simply needs to login via one of the provided social/external providers. The site maintains only name and email (where available) and requires no further authorisation. The application will try to reduce (where technically supported by the providers) the amount of information/authorization required. Some specifics are noted below

#### Flickr

We ask for read access. This is the lowest form of access flickr gives. Without it - we can't even get a login. However - we do not store the authorization tokens and can therefore do nothing with the users photos.

#### Facebook

We ask for email access. We do this to grab the e-mail address (e-mail will not be used for any kind of spam etc - we're looking at in future supporting wishlist functionality where price warnings can be sent amongst other things - but they will only be where the user themselves have asked for e-mail to be sent).

### Receipts and Documents

The app links to dropbox. You will need a dropbox account. Simply upload your receipts and docuements (manuals etc) in PDF form to the Photo Gear directory (at the time of writing this would be your dropbox/Apps/Photo Gear) using whatever subdirectories you want.

Note that as of now - we don't support spotting files that are moved around after the links are created in the app.
